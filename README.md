## 👩‍💻 Technology

🔸 **React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js** make up the technology stack. 

🔸 Utilizing the **REST API** technique, API calls are made to the backend. 

🔸 For real-time editor updating, the program makes advantage of **webSockets**, that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between    the user's browser and a server.

🔸 **Sass** was used to style and arrange the layout (functions, mixins, variables).

🔸 **Middleware** was utilized in actions integrating authentication and authorization.

🔸 Drag-and-drop application added using an **open source library** that enables simple integration of drag-and-drop functionality to the app.
