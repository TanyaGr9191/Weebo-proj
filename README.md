## Technology

>**React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js** make up the technology stack. 
>
>Utilizing the **REST API** technique, API calls are made to the backend. 
>
>For real-time editor updating, the program makes advantage of **webSockets**, that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.
>
>**Sass** was used to style and arrange the layout (functions, mixins, variables).
>
>**Middleware** was utilized in actions integrating authentication and authorization.
>
>Drag-and-drop application added using an **open source library** that enables simple integration of drag-and-drop functionality to the app.

## Take your first step

1. Clone the project or download the files by going to the repository up above.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TanyaGr9191/Weebo-proj.git
```
2. Go to the backend folder:
```sh
cd backend
```

> **Note:** Ensure that node_modules are installed first.

3. Next, we'll start the server with 'npm start':
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
>**Note:** You should receive a terminal output verifying the server's status at port 3030.

4. Now carry out the same steps for the frontend folder.

> **Note:** A terminal output at localhost:3000 should be displayed once the server is up and running.

All done! You have completed the first step with Weebo. Now the app is active!
